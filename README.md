# Why
"sharing economy". This innovative mode of operation has become one of the hottest concepts. Under the influence of the Internet and smartphones and the diversification of payment.

So when I thought about my project, I began to think about and explore how to use this concept. At first, my idea was actually a topic about saving the earth's ecological environment. Later, for many reasons, I changed it to the subject of Tool Man.

>### Main concept 
"It doesn't matter if it lasts forever, it only cares about having it." This advertisement can be said to be the most appropriate portrayal of the sharing economy. With the shared concept of "use instead of owning", you can use the skills of the other people and share your expertise too, create a network of tool man communities.
